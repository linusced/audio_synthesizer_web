# audio_synthesizer_web
This is a web version of my c++ program [Audio Synthesizer](https://github.com/linusced/audio_synthesizer/). This is a simple web project for audio synthesis using additive synthesis with 50 harmonics. There is also an ADSR envelope and a simple Low Pass Filter and a simple High Pass Filter. This is written in vanilla JS/CSS/HTML.

# How to use
Simply open [Audio Synthesizer Web](https://linusced.github.io/audio_synthesizer_web) in your browser and try it out yourself.
